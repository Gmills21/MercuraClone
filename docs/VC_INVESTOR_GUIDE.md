# VC Investor Guide: Evaluating OpenMercura
## What Makes a Great B2B SaaS Business

---

## 1. STICKINESS & RETENTION

### Why It Matters
B2B SaaS with <5% monthly churn is worth 3-5x more than high-churn businesses. Stickiness comes from:

**Data Lock-in**
- Customers store quotes, products, customer data
- Migrating = pain
- **Score: ✅ GOOD** - We have data storage

**Integration Stickiness**
- Connected to ERP (SAP, QuickBooks)
- API integrations
- **Score: ⚠️ MEDIUM** - CSV export helps, need more native integrations

**Workflow Habits**
- Daily use = sticky
- Weekly/monthly = churn risk
- **Score: ⚠️ MEDIUM** - Sales reps use when quotes come in (event-driven)

### Fixes Needed:
- [ ] Add native QuickBooks API (not just CSV)
- [ ] Build email automation (follow-ups, reminders)
- [ ] Create "Quote Templates" for repeat customers
- [ ] Add calendar integration (delivery scheduling)

---

## 2. NETWORK EFFECTS

### Types
**Direct Network Effects**
- More users = more value
- **Score: ❌ NONE** - Single-company use

**Data Network Effects**
- More data = better AI
- **Score: ⚠️ POTENTIAL** - Product matching improves with catalog size

**Marketplace Effects**
- Buyers + sellers
- **Score: ❌ NONE** - Not a marketplace

### Fixes Needed:
- [ ] Anonymous pricing database ("others paid $X for this")
- [ ] Industry benchmarks ("HVAC contractors see 40% margins")
- [ ] Supplier network (connect buyers to suppliers)

---

## 3. PRICING POWER

### Current Model
- Free self-hosted
- Pay for AI features?
- Not clear from code

### VC-Grade Pricing Strategy:
**Land & Expand**
- Free: 1 user, 10 quotes/month
- Pro: $49/mo unlimited
- Enterprise: $199/mo + SSO + API

**Usage-Based**
- Per quote over limit
- AI extraction credits
- Storage over 1GB

**Score: ❌ MISSING** - No clear monetization

### Fixes Needed:
- [ ] Implement tiered pricing
- [ ] Add usage limits on free tier
- [ ] Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs)
- [ ] Annual billing discounts

---

## 4. SALES EFFICIENCY (CAC/LTV)

### Ideal Metrics
- CAC Payback: <12 months
- LTV/CAC: >3x
- Sales Cycle: <60 days

### Current State:
- **CAC: $0** (no paid marketing)
- **LTV: Unknown** (no churn data)
- **Sales: Self-serve** (no sales team)

**Score: ⚠️ UNPROVEN** - PLG is good but need data

### Fixes Needed:
- [ ] Track cohort retention
- [ ] Measure activation (first quote created)
- [ ] Add expansion revenue tracking
- [ ] Test paid acquisition (small budget)

---

## 5. DEFENSIBILITY (MOAT)

### Moat Types:
**Brand**
- "The Mercura for SMBs"
- **Score: ⚠️ BUILDING** - Early stage

**Technology**
- AI extraction
- **Score: ⚠️ WEAK** - Can be copied

**Data**
- Quote history, pricing
- **Score: ✅ GOOD** - Accumulates over time

**Switching Costs**
- ERP integrations
- **Score: ⚠️ MEDIUM** - CSV = low switching cost

### Fixes Needed:
- [ ] Build proprietary dataset (industry pricing)
- [ ] Add AI training on user catalogs
- [ ] Community/template marketplace
- [ ] Certifications (SOC 2, etc.)

---

## 6. MARKET SIZE (TAM/SAM/SOM)

### Construction/Distribution RFQ Market
- **TAM**: $20B (all quoting software)
- **SAM**: $5B (SMB segment)
- **SOM**: $500M (bootstrapped-friendly segment)

**Verdict: ✅ GOOD** - Big enough for $50-100M exit

---

## 7. GROWTH LEVERS

### Current:
- Word of mouth
- SEO (content marketing)

### Missing:
- [ ] Viral loops (invite team members)
- [ ] Integrations marketplace
- [ ] Agency/partner program
- [ ] Industry verticals

---

## 8. UNIT ECONOMICS SCORECARD

| Metric | Target | Current | Grade |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Gross Margin | >80% | ~85% | ✅ A |
| Churn | <5%/mo | Unknown | ⚠️ ? |
| NRR | >100% | Unknown | ⚠️ ? |
| CAC Payback | <12mo | $0 | ✅ A |
| LTV/CAC | >3x | Unknown | ⚠️ ? |

**Overall Grade: B-** (need retention data)

---

## 9. RED FLAGS FOR VCs

### Current Red Flags:
1. ❌ No clear monetization model visible
2. ❌ Single founder (if true) - key person risk
3. ⚠️ No enterprise security (SOC 2, etc.)
4. ⚠️ UI looks "vibe coded" (unprofessional)
5. ⚠️ No mobile app

### Must Fix Before Fundraising:
- [ ] Professional rebrand
- [ ] Clear pricing page
- [ ] Security certifications
- [ ] Case studies / testimonials
- [ ] Mobile-responsive app

---

## 10. VC PITCH NARRATIVE

**Current Story:**
"Free open-source Mercura.ai clone"

**Better Story:**
"The Shopify of RFQ automation - democratizing AI quoting for the 98% of distributors that can't afford $50K/year enterprise software"

**Key Metrics to Show:**
- $X ARR, growing Y% MoM
- Z% of customers export to QuickBooks (ecosystem play)
- Avg customer creates B quotes/month (engagement)
- C% expansion revenue (upsell success)
