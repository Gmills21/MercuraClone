## 4. NOTES ON PRODUCT CATALOGS & SPEC SHEETS

**Status:** Could not find extractable text versions online

**Why:** Major industrial suppliers (McMaster-Carr, Grainger, Emerson, etc.) either:
- Host PDFs only (binary format, not text-extractable via web fetch)
- Use JavaScript-heavy catalogs that block scraping
- Require login/authentication to access

**Alternative Sources for Real Documents:**
1. **Your actual customers** - Ask them for sample catalogs they receive from suppliers
2. **Local distributors** - Contact regional industrial suppliers for sample product sheets
3. **Trade shows** - Collect physical catalogs and scan/OCR them
4. **Manufacturer websites** - Download PDFs directly:
   - www.mcmaster.com (hardware/industrial)
   - www.grainger.com (maintenance supplies)
   - www.emerson.com (valves/automation)
   - www.honeywell.com (controls/sensors)

**For Testing Knowledge Base Feature:**
You can create test documents from:
- Wikipedia articles about industrial products (factual, structured)
- Open-source technical documentation
- Your own product descriptions copied into TXT files
