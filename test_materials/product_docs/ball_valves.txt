# Ball Valve Technical Specifications
## Product Information Document

### Overview
A ball valve is a form of quarter-turn valve which uses a hollow, perforated and pivoting ball to control flow through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line with the flow and closed when it is pivoted 90-degrees by the valve handle. The handle lies flat in alignment with the flow when open, and is perpendicular to it when closed, making for easy visual confirmation of the valve's status.

### Types of Ball Valves

**1. Full Port Ball Valve**
- Has an oversized ball so that the hole in the ball is the same size as the pipeline
- Results in lower friction loss and allows for pigging
- Flow path is straight with minimal pressure drop
- Best for: Applications requiring pigging, throttling service

**2. Reduced Port (Standard Port) Ball Valve**
- Flow through the valve is one pipe size smaller than the valve's pipe size
- Results in slightly higher velocity but lower cost
- More economical choice for most applications
- Best for: General purpose on/off service

**3. V-Port Ball Valve**
- Has a "V" shaped ball or seat
- Allows for precise flow control and modulating applications
- Linear flow characteristics
- Best for: Flow control, modulating service

**4. Multi-Port Ball Valve**
- Has multiple ports (3-way or 4-way configurations)
- Allows for flow direction changes
- Common in mixing or diverting applications
- Best for: Diverting flow, mixing applications
